      <h2>top 3 dwarves</h2>

      <p>Dwarves are the main playable characters of Deep Rock Galactic. They are the main employees of the titular company, famously regarded for their rugged survival tactics and stubborn personalities, particularly for operations on Hoxxes IV. The dwarves are decked out with the heaviest weapons and the most advanced gadgets available to brave dangerous caves and bring back valuable minerals for which they are paid in credits and a share in minerals which can be used to upgrade their gear.</p>

      <p>There are four playable dwarves in the game who all specialize in a certain duty. Strong emphasis is placed on effective teamwork between the four dwarves to maximize and minimize their unique strengths and weaknesses respectively, for a lone dwarf is easy prey for the many varieties of hostile Hoxxes IV wildlife.</p>

      <p>The dwarves all share the same voice actor, Javier O'Neill, with each dwarf's voice having its own unique pitch and speed. All four dwarves share the same voicelines, with exception of class-specific lines.</p>
